<h1>Background</h1>
                         
<p>
My background as a former Pilot Officer for United Airlines, flight school owner, and instructor has served me well as a Technical Writer and  Technical Publications Manager. Because of the technical aptitude required in becoming a pilot, I found that I was naturally curious and could easily master software and hardware tools, Web site creation and design, and writing for Developers. As a  business owner, I could easily organize and manage writing teams, and oversee documentation delivery schedules.
